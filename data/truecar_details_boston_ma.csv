Yet the sheer variety within the Ford F-150 lineup has always set this truck apart from its rivals. You can choose a stripped-down work truck, lather on the luxury with plush versions like the King Ranch, or equip your 2014 F-150 as a serious off-roader via the specialized SVT Raptor model. Whatever your tastes, you're almost certain to find a 2014 Ford F-150 that meets your needs.The customization starts in the engine bay of the Ford F-150, which has four available power plants, ranging from a base V6 to a 6.2-liter V8. All are worthwhile choices, but the most compelling option is the midrange EcoBoost 3.5-liter V6 engine: It makes as much torque as most V8 engines and provides equivalent towing capacity. And if you drive your truck every day, you'll be happy to know this is also the most fuel-efficient of the available F-150 engines.Inside, the 2014 F-150 offers plenty of room, particularly in the popular SuperCrew body style, and you can equip it with all manner of modern conveniences, including a rearview camera, dual USB ports, an integrated trailer-brake controller and a voice-activated navigation system (although, for many drivers, the complexity of the MyFord Touch interface takes away some of the convenience). In other respects, though, the Ford is starting to show its age. Interior materials quality is only so-so, and extended-cab models (SuperCabs, that is) still have cumbersome, reverse-hinged rear doors, whereas most other trucks have adopted front-hinged doors.",

The average list price for similar models is$6,460.Learn More","Two years ago in a family sedan comparison test, we declared: 'How about that, folks? The best family sedan can now be found at a Ford dealership.' It wasn't a close contest, as the Ford Fusion received universal praise from us for a well-rounded nature that included an engaging driving demeanor, comfy ride, ample features and a spacious, well-built cabin. Of course, two years can be a lifetime in the car biz, but the 2012 Ford Fusion continues to stand tall as a top choice nevertheless.It all starts with a vehicle architecture that gives the Fusion a great balance between a comfortable ride and agile handling. You feel connected to the road, but this doesn't come at the expense of ride comfort the way it can in so many other cars. The Fusion's interior isn't especially flashy, and its climate controls are mounted too low, but quality is strong both in terms of materials and construction. The spacious cabin is also filled with all the expected bells and whistles in this class, plus a few high-tech extras.Under the hood, the Fusion is a tad different from its competition. Its base 175-horsepower four-cylinder is pretty much the norm, but there are two V6 engine upgrades available rather than the typical one. The more common 3.0-liter V6 produces only 240 hp, which is considerably less than its rivals. The Fusion Sport, however, gets a more competitive 263-hp V6 that gets nearly the same fuel economy as the smaller six-cylinder. In other words, if you want V6 power in your Fusion, we'd suggest the Sport.",

The 2015 Audi Q5 crossover could serve as Exhibit A.Take a look at one at a dealer and you'll no doubt find that it looks great and has an interior that oozes luxury. You'll probably find a Q5 that suits your powertrain desires, too. Audi offers it with everything from a turbocharged four-cylinder engine to a turbocharged diesel V6, throwing in a supercharged V6 and a four-cylinder hybrid system for good measure. Although the Q5 is one of the older members of its class, with roots stretching back to 2009, consistent updates over the years have maintained its leading status.Audi's engineers have also been trying to make their creations more fun to drive, and the Q5 is exemplary here as well. It really does feel at home dashing between corners on a country road. The downside is that on bumpy roads the Q5 will jostle you around more than competing rivals.

The average list price for similar models is$9,782.Learn More","The 2014 Ford Escape stands out as one of the best small crossovers in a segment full of worthy entries. Completely redesigned last year, the Ford Escape remains one of our favorite compact crossover SUVs. It has sharp handling, handsome styling and high-end interior touches that help justify its marginally higher price in this class.You don't have to look at the 2014 Ford Escape for very long before you start to think it looks like a pumped-up Ford Focus, and with good reason. The Escape is based on the same platform as the Focus, and it shows in the sleek styling. We love the Ford Focus for its quality, versatility and superb driving character, and those traits translate well to the Escape package. Sure, the Escape is heavier than a Focus, but it still has a nicely controlled ride and goes around turns with a surprising level of agility.Ford offers a trio of four-cylinder engines on the 2014 Escape. The base 2.5-liter four-cylinder, which is a pretty typical offering for a small crossover, provides adequate performance. But what help distinguish the Escape in this class are the available 1.6-liter and 2.0-liter turbocharged engines. The 1.6 provides more power and better fuel economy than the 2.5, while the 2.0 cranks out 240 horsepower and has only slightly lower EPA fuel economy ratings than the smaller 1.6.The Escape's interior is furnished with high-quality materials, and when it's equipped with the slick-looking MyFord Touch electronics interface, it feels as if you're driving a much more expensive car. The downside to that, however, is that MyFord Touch can be finicky to use at times, as we've noted slow response times and inconvenient glitches in the vehicles we've tested. Besides that, ticking all the option boxes pushes the 2014 Ford Escape's price above its direct rivals. Keep the equipment level reasonable, though, and it represents solid value in this class.",

Unlike some competitors, most of these features can only be ordered on the top trim level, but at least you can get them. Also available are a panoramic sunroof, a surround-view parking camera and ventilated front seats  rare options in this class.We also like that the Equinox offers two alternative powertrains if you aren't satisfied with the base turbocharged 1.5-liter engine. At one end of the spectrum is a fuel-efficient diesel that achieves 32 mpg in combined driving (the standard engine earns 28 mpg); at the other, a turbocharged 2.0-liter with an additional 80 horsepower. Be careful, however: Once you start checking the options boxes, the Equinox can be substantially more expensive than rival crossovers. An engine stop-start system that cannot be disabled and disappointing materials quality also might give prospective buyers pause.",
